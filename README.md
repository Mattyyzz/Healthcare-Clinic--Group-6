## Problem Description:

Our team spearheaded the design and implementation of a comprehensive relational database tailored for a prominent healthcare clinic company. At the heart of our model lies the healthcare center entity, serving as the nexus from which various departments extend, each housing imperative entities ranging from inventory management to billing records, appointment scheduling, and patient information. With attention to detail, we crafted a data model that encapsulates the entirety of our organizational needs.
