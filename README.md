## Problem Description:

Our team spearheaded designing and implementation a comprehensive relational database tailored for a prominent healthcare clinic company. At the heart of our model lies the healthcare center entity, serving as the nexus from which various departments extend, each housing imperative entities ranging from inventory management to billing records, appointment scheduling, and patient information. With attention to detail, we crafted a data model that encapsulates our sample healthcare clinic needs. We populated the database with potential data, ensuring its readiness to support operational functionalities. Moreover, we executed various simple and complex queries utilizing our data, showcasing the database's adaptability to interested parties. Our efforts culminated in a sophisticated database solution poised to streamline operations and enhance decision-making within the healthcare clinic world.
